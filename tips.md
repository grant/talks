## CfP

1. **Keep it short:** This talk demonstrates why open source is a key component of modern software
development by following the evolution of Kubernetes.
1. **Focus on the attendee:** In this presentation, attendees will learn the steps for connecting a Raspberry Pi to a
Kubernetes cluster and its importance.
    - Leave notes to reviewers:
      - NOTE: This is a live demo, but it does not rely on the public Internet and can run entirely
from my local laptop.
      - NOTE: Thank you for taking the time to review this talk. I appreciate it.
1. **Focus on benefit over content:** Attendees will learn how to automate control of a light bulb using Kubernetes and a
Raspberry Pi.
1. **Avoid being too technical:** Attendees will learn how to control a light bulb using Kubernetes and a Raspberry Pi.
1. **Avoid being too specific:** Attendees will learn how to control a light bulb using a cluster scheduler and a
microcontroller. While this talk uses Kubernetes and a Raspberry Pi, the concepts
are largely applicable to many technologies.
1. **Don't cliff-hang:** After unplugging our servers as part of routine chaos engineering, our Zookeeper
cluster was unable to elect a leader. This talk discusses how we diagnosed the
problem, fixed it while minimizing downtime, and submitted a patch to fix the
problem upstream.
1. **Empathize with reviewers**
1. **Use an enticing, succinct title:**
    - ✗: How I used Kubernetes to take down all of production with one command
    - ✓: Safeguarding Kubernetes ACLs
    - ✗: Introduction to Kubernetes
    - ✓: Kubernetes for Startups
1. Use bullets, outlines, formating
    - The key takeaways will be:
        1. How to peel bananas
        1. Hot to slice apples
1. **Active verb tense, everywhere**
    - Attendees will learn...
    - We will explore a demo...

Examples:

- X is a great way to do Y. This talk will teach you everything to do Z including a, b, c. After this talk, you'll be ready to foo.
- Have you wanted to do X but didn't make progress? Y can help you do X. This talk will teach you how to A, how to B, and how C can help too. After this talk...
- Question? Fact helps. This talk will teach attendees how to X including (list A, B, C). After this talk, attendees can Z!
