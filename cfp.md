Here are some tips.

## About You

Conference organizers want unique and stellar presenters and leaders with strong opinions and views that will engage the audience and inspire peers.

- Expert in field â€“ driving best practices
- Focus on intermediate/advanced level talk. This is most interesting.

## Level

- 100 introductory: Assumes little to no experience with topic
- 200 intermediate: Provides real-world samples with moderate technical detail
- 300 advanced: Requires in-depth understanding of technical features
- 400 expert: Provides expert-to-expert talk with deep technical knowledge

## Topic

- Choose a topic for the talk (appropriate for the level).
- KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE
- Be catchy (as if scrolling Twitter).
- Abstract should tell a story. This is your elevator pitch.
- Be clear & concise about what the audience is going to learn. Be convincing

## Length

- 20 minute talk + 10 min Q/A is ideal
