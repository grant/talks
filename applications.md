## All About Apps Script

**Type**: Session

Learn how to increase the power of your favorite Google apps â€” like Calendar, Docs, Drive, Gmail, Sheets, and Slides.
Apps Script lets you enhance, all on a JavaScript platform in the cloud.

I really think that this session would inspire anyone who uses these tools (i.e. Gmail, Slides) daily. (Hoping to get the "You can do THAT?" reaction.)

It's really amazing how some companies run their businesses off of Google Sheets and Apps Script.

At the time of this conference, the team and I will have a TypeScript community around Apps Script. I'd love to talk about this too. Given this application is 6+ months away from the date, and the fact this community moves really fast, I can't make promises. There has been good interest with the community and the new tool I've built, clasp: github.com/google/clasp
