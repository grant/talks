## 2019, Node+JS Interactive 2019

Title: Go Serverless with Google Cloud Functions
Abstract: Your development agility comes from building systems composed of small, independent units of functionality focused on doing one thing well. Cloud Functions lets you build and deploy services at the level of a single function, not at the level of entire applications, containers, or VMs. In this session, you will learn the fundamentals about Google Cloud Functions, some use-cases, and how to write Cloud Functions in TypeScript!
Benefits to the ecosystem: Node developers can deploy their applications to the cloud in seconds. With a little extra setup, you can use a TypeScript build and test your functions locally in the same environment that is used in production.
Tech requirements: No extra requirements.
Would love to incorporate my saxophone into the talk (like I do in SF) if it's encouraged.

## 2019, Feb 7-8 All About Apps Script

**Event**: jsconfhi.com
**Type**: Session

Learn how to increase the power of your favorite Google apps — like Calendar, Docs, Drive, Gmail, Sheets, and Slides.
Apps Script lets you enhance, all on a JavaScript platform in the cloud.

---
I really think that this session would inspire anyone who uses these tools (i.e. Gmail, Slides) daily. (Hoping to get the "You can do THAT?" reaction.)

It's really amazing how some companies run their businesses off of Google Sheets and Apps Script. 

---
At the time of this conference, the team and I will have a TypeScript community around Apps Script. I'd love to talk about this too. Given this application is 6+ months away from the date, and the fact this community moves really fast, I can't make promises. There has been good interest with the community and the new tool I've built, clasp: github.com/google/clasp

## 2018, Nov 9 All About Apps Script

**Job Title**: Developer Platform Engineer, Google
**Title**: All About Apps Script, JavaScript in Google Cloud

**Abstract**:
Learn how to increase the power of your favorite Google apps — like Calendar, Docs, Drive, Gmail, Sheets, and Slides. Apps Script lets you enhance, all on a serverless JavaScript platform in Google Cloud.

**Why do you think this talk would be a good fit for the audience?**
Google has an incredibly powerful (yet relatively unknown) JavaScript platform that makes programming with APIs from Gmail to Salesforce dead simple. In this talk, I'll show you how to leverage Google Apps Script to build powerful automations in minutes. #serverless #gsuite #javascript

**Anything else we should know?**
I'm also interested in speaking at dotGo 2019 about G Suite APIs in Go.
