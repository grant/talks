# Slides

Most of my content around slides is internal, but here are some tips:

- Minimize content
  - The audience should pay attention to what the speaker is saying. Make slides minimal
- Font
  - Min 18pt. Should be readable on phone
- Less is more
  - Remove non-critical info: punctuation, complete sentences, explanations
  - Code does not have to compile: no imports, complete braces
  - Show minimum amount of code: desaturate code or use ... for other code
  - Reveal gradually: show bullets 1 by 1. Code in successive parts
  - Make important parts prominent (bold, large)
  - Space out content evenly (vert/horiz)
  - Visuals are faster than text
- Each slide should motivate the next slide. This will have the viewer follow your thinking.
  - Why is this important?
- High-level overview, then zoom down to technical details.
